            header: Identify Compound Candidates from Cancer Cell Line Screens
            body: Interrogate cell line compound screening trials from large established sources (CCLE, CTRP, GDSC). Dig into compound sensitivity trends within a particular disease and explore associated metadata.
            body2: For example, select a FDA compound that is widely known to prevent/treat a particular disease phenotype (ex. Paclitaxel, breast cancer treatment) and identify other compounds that show a similar impact on cell lines.
